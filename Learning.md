# Algorithm

## Big O

the efficiency measure of an algorithm is

- always look for loops

## question to ask before writing an algorithm

- it depends
- who is the end user
- what is my constraint
- what devices I am running on (5G or 2G)
- how important is this to the user
- how big is the data set
- any more information

## Spatial Complexity

- how many space is it going to take

## Trade offs
